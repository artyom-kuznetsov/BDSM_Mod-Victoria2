Project Alice version 1.1.1

Project Alice is developed by a small team of volunteers. We rely largely on the community to help us identify and fix bugs and other problems. So, if you encounter a problem, please read the September 2023 update for a description of the kind of information we need and then make a bug report or let us know in some other way that there is a problem. If you do not report the issues you encounter, they will not get fixed.

Supported hardware: Windows 10 or newer is also required to run the program.

Installing: Move the executable files and the assets folder into your main Victoria 2 directory. In other words, Alice.exe should end up in the same folder as v2game.exe. IF YOU INSTALLED A PREVIOUS DEMO OR RELEASE: I suggest that you delete it and the old assets folder before copying over the new one, as an extra precaution.

Launching: Start the game by running launch_alice.exe. Mods may or may not run with more or less problems (see the October update and the compatibility patches channel in the discord for more information about particular mods).

Playing: You can type "help" into the console to get a list of supported commands.

Multiplayer: consult https://github.com/schombert/Project-Alice/blob/main/docs/multiplayer.md for a guide to how to get a multiplayer game running. Questions concerning multiplayer working should be directed towards Leaf.
