V2DLL is a reverse engineering project that makes possible a handful of things that were considered impossible/hard to implement before, 
and even make some previously existing .exe patches simpler to use.
Also it improves performance and multiplayer stability significantly.
This is meant to be easy-for-use for other modders, so I'm not going into much detail here. If you want more insight, 
or add some custom patches, or perhaps investigate v2dll under the hood to use for your own work - check the source code.


It was made for my mod - https://github.com/artyom-kuznetsov/BDSM_Mod-Victoria2  
Since, it has some mod-specific features. But most of them can be reused for any other mod.  
Honestly, even if you play vanilla - there is no downside in using V2DLL (don't forget to configure it!)
Almost all of this was tested in MP - no stability effects noticed.

## How to install V2DLL
1. Put all the files from V2DLL folder into the same folder where you have v2game.exe and lua51.dll
2. Tweak v2dll_settings.ini for your liking - every patch is optional (some of them have to be ran in tandem though).
3. Launch the game as usual, with any mod you like.

## How does it work?
Vanilla file lua51.dll is replaced by a brand new file, where the patches are coded.  
The old file must still remain in the folder under name "lua51_real.dll" - 
it's being called by the new file, so no vanilla code is lost and the game can still run.
  
There are also d3d9.dll and dgVoodoo.conf files.  
Those are needed for some performance patches.  
  
# Feature overview
## Explaining each option in the .ini file
### Local Config
#### LOCAL_MOD_CONFIG
This option allows to use different configurations for different installed mods. All you need to do
is copy the .ini file to a mod folder, and launch the mod as usual.

### Military
#### 1. PATCH_ALWAYS_ADD_WARGOALS
Zombiefreak's patch for enabling adding wargoals without having positive warscore.
#### 2. PATCH_LAND_REINFORCE / PATCH_NAVAL_REINFORCE
Zombiefreak's patches to make navies and brigades inside armies and fleets reinforce separately, fixing slower than intended reinforcement under insufficient supplies.
#### 3. PATCH_ALLIED_REINFORCE_150
Increases reinforce rate on allied land from 100% to 150%. Note, that without "PATCH_OCCUPIED_REINFORCE_SPLIT" patch,  
reinforce rate will still be 150% in ally-occupied provinces, not just owned.
#### 4. PATCH_OCCUPIED_REINFORCE_SPLIT / PATCH_ALLY_OWNER_CHECK
Splits reinforce rates on allied land into allied-owned and allied-occupied land. Allied-occupied reinforce rate is 100%, the same as if you occupy it yourself.  
Needs to be used with "PATCH_ALLIED_REINFORCE_150" to achieve a total effect of just increasing reinforce rate in allied-owned land.
#### 5. PATCH_COMBAT_ROLL
Enables patch for dice rolls in battle.
#### 6. COMBAT_ROLL_MIN / COMBAT_ROLL_MAX
Min and Max dice rolls in battle.  
  
### Economic
#### 1. ENABLE_PRICE_DELTA
Prices shift by 0.25% of the base price instead of flat 0.01 per day.
#### 2. PATCH_EXPONENTIAL_PRICE_DELTA
Enables exponential price shifts instead of flat or percentual. INCOMPATIBLE with №1 (made by vesper).
#### 3. PATCH_MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE
Just changes the price ceiling from x5 of base price to x20 of it.  
Note: an overflow might occur that will break your game if prices of some factory inputs go beyond its max savings. I recommend increasing MAX_FACTORY_MONEY_SAVE define if you are using this.
#### 4. PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_IGNORE_COLONIAL_1 / PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_IGNORE_COLONIAL_2
Allow construction of factories in colonial regions. Needs to be used together with UI №5.
#### 5. PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_BUTTON_ENABLE_IGNORE_COLONIAL
Button called "hide_colonial_states" in production menu will now toggle visibility of colonial regions in the menu.
#### 6. PATCH_LOCAL_SUPPLY_FACTORY_IGNORE_COLONIAL
Allows construction factories with "limit_by_local_supply = yes" attribute to be constructed in colonies (hi vic uni)  
You don't need this if you enable №9.
#### 7. PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_IGNORE_UNCIVILIZED_BUTTON, PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_CHECKLIST_UNCIVILIZED_OWN, PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_CHECKLIST_UNCIVILIZED_OTHER, PATCH_BUILD_FACTORY_IGNORE_UNCIVILIZED_CAN_BUILD
Allows uncivilized countries to construct factories.
#### 8. PATCH_PROD_TYPE_GATE
Has to be enabled for №4, №5 and №6.
#### 9. PROD_TYPE_GATE_ALLOW_ALL
Allows construction of all factories in colonial regions, not just whitelisted (see №10) and ones with "limit_by_local_supply = yes" attribute.
#### 10. PROD_TYPE_GATE_EXTRA_WHITELIST=X
Type in production types separated by comma to allow constructing them in colonial regions, if you do not intend allowing all factories.  
Can work together with №6.  
  
### UI
#### 1. ENABLE_BUTTONS
Adds support for a few new buttons:  
- FE_ACADEMIES_BDSM; must be located in tech menu; triggers decision "open_academy_decisions_dec"  
- FE_RPROJECTS_BDSM; must be located in tech menu; triggers decision "open_research_projects_dec"  
- FE_BUDGET_DIPLO_BDSM; must be located in budget menu; triggers decision "exchange_settings_dec"  
^ those decisions have to be available to be clicked for the country (potential and allow triggers have to be true).
#### 2. ENABLE_DECISION_FILTER
Hides abovementioned decisions from the regular decision menu (basically I'm decluttering dec menu by adding new buttons for some decs).
#### 3. ENABLE_POP_DISPLAY
Total population is displayed in some surface tooltips, instead of "grown male" population. Not in all of them, so it might confuse the player a bit.
#### 4. ENABLE_VERSION_LABEL
Changes version label in main menu to "V2 v3.04 + V2DLL v*"
#### 5. PATCH_PROD_LIST_VISIBILITY
Needed for Economic №4.
#### 6. HIDE_UNAVAILABLE_LIMIT_BY_SUPPLY_FACTORIES
Hides factories with "limit_by_local_supply = yes" from factory construction menu if there is no required supply in the region.
  
### Miscellaneous
#### 1. PATCH_CONSCIOUSNESS_PLURALITY_GROWTH
Removes plurality growth from average consciousness. In-game tooltip says otherwise though. So this patch removes this tooltip too (hi tgc)
#### 2. PATCH_CIVILIZE_NULL_CHECK
Fixes a crash when a country that has factories civilizes. Idk if it's really required I use AI to make all of this lol
#### 3. PATCH_GRAPH_POINT_CLAMP
Prevents the game from crashing from overflow I talked about in Economic №2 (doesn't prevent it from happening though).
#### 4. PATCH_ALLOW_UNCIV_TECH_RESEARCH
Allows non-ai uncivs to research tech. (made by maxioten).
#### 5. PATCH_ARISTOCRAT_INCOME_SHARE
Doubles aristocrat income share from RGO (made by vesper).
  
### Stability and Performance
#### 1. PATCH_FPU_FORTRESS / PATCH_D3D_FPU_PRESERVE
Fixes some float math errors related to different GPU/Drivers (fixes some of desync cases) (made by av213238).
#### 2. PATCH_THREAD_FPU_PIN
Fixes some math errors related to multi-threading (fixes some of desync cases) (made by av213238).
#### 3. PATCH_HEAP_LFH
Decreases RAM fragmentation over long game sessions (might decrease RAM usage) (made by av213238).
#### 4. ENGINE_WORKER_THREADS
Set to 0 to automatically use all available threads. This will improve performance. 
In theory, might reduce desync probability if all lobby participants have the same setting (made by av213238).
#### 5. PATCH_POP_QUANTIZE / POP_QUANTIZE_KEEP_BITS
Rouns up microscopic pop attributes (money, savings, etc) that you would never even see in game. 
Might decrease related desync probability and improve performance a bit (rounds up to 12 bits by default, vanilla is 15) (made by av213238).
#### 6. PATCH_MP_CLIENT_SLEEP / MP_CLIENT_SLEEP_MS
Removes sleepers, that reduce FPS. Experimental (made by av213238).
#### 7. PATCH_MAIN_LOOP_SLEEP0 / MAIN_LOOP_SLEEP_MS
In theory also improves performace of the host/singleplayer. Experimental (made by av213238).
#### 8. PATCH_D3D_NO_VSYNC
Force disables VSYNC. Experimental. (made by av213238).
#### 9. D3D_FPS_LIMIT
FPS Limiter. Set to 0 to disable.
#### 10. FIX_SFX_MIXER_LAG
Fixes behaviour where game constantly tries to access sound mixer for no reason. Huge performance improvement,
especially noticeable on non-host client in a MP lobby. Enable sleeper patches above. (made by av213238).
#### 11. FIX_ARMY_WINDOW_LAG
Fixes stutters while army/armies are selected.
#### 12. PATCH_HIGH_PRIORITY
Prioritizes the game process. Supposed a marginal performance gain (made by av213238).

  
### Diagnostics

Just the log used for debugging the .dll
#### 2. PATCH_FACTORY_DUMP_SCAN
I used this to debug overflow related to Economic №3 (didn't help much).
#### 3. ENABLE_OOS_LOG
Logs used for debugging multiplayer out-of-syncs (made by av213238).
#### 4. ENABLE_CRASH_LOG
Crash log :) (made by av213238).
#### 5. ENABLE_CRASH_DUMP
Creates Windows memory dump on game crash (made by av213238).
#### 5. HIDE_NO_SUPPLY_DRY_RUN
