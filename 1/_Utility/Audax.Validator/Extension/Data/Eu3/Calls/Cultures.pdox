		# Exactly. This was added by Paradox in HTTT and means there can 
		# now be a maximum of 2 cultural unions per culture group. One 
		# designated by the event command and one that has it as an 
		# inherent ability of it's tag. I'm not sure what would happen 
		# if you used the command on more than one country but according 
		# to one of the paradox staff (can't remember which one) it only
		# works for one country.
		# In vanilla it's used for forming the HRE (a country that needs
		# to be a cultural union but the Germany tag already has that 
		# ability). I use it for culture group union where a union tag would 
		# feel out of place but cultures banding together under an existing 
		# country would make some sense.
		# Like with the culture_union tag the country needs to have a primary 
		# culture actually in the cultural group it is a union of for the union 
		# to work. I don't see how the validator could check for that though.
